# concrete-crack-classifier
here we a building a concrete crack classifier using transfer learning.
here we are using vgg16 model and resnet50 model(prebuilt models)
we are tinkering them by adding an additional layer to get out desired classifier .
so we are using the tensorflow framework and keras API
